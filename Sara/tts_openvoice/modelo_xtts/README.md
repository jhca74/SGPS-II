There is no need for an excessive amount of training data that spans countless hours.This is the same or similar model to what powers [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai/) and [Coqui API](https://docs.coqui.ai/docs).### Features- Supports 17 languages. - Voice cloning with just a 6-second audio clip.- Emotion and style transfer by cloning. - Cross-language voice cloning.- Multi-lingual speech generation.- 24khz sampling rate.### Updates over XTTS-v1- 2 new languages; Hungarian and Korean- Architectural improvements for speaker conditioning.- Enables the use of multiple speaker references and interpolation between speakers.- Stability improvements.- Better prosody and audio quality across the board.### LanguagesXTTS-v2 supports 17 languages: **English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt),Polish (pl), Turkish (tr), Russian (ru), Dutch (nl), Czech (cs), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh-cn), Japanese (ja), Hungarian (hu), Korean (ko)Hindi (hi)**.Stay tuned as we continue to add support for more languages. If you have any language requests, feel free to reach out!### CodeThe [code-base](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) supports inference and [fine-tuning](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/xtts.html#training).### Demo Spaces- [XTTS Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/coqui/xtts)  :  You can see how model performs on supported languages, and try with your own reference or microphone input- [XTTS Voice Chat with Mistral or Zephyr](https://huggingface.co/spaces/coqui/voice-chat-with-mistral) : You can experience streaming voice chat with Mistral 7B Instruct or Zephyr 7B Beta|                                 |                                         || ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- || ðŸ¸ðŸ’¬ **CoquiTTS**               | [coqui/TTS on Github](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)|| ðŸ’¼ **Documentation**            | [ReadTheDocs](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)| ðŸ‘©â€ðŸ’» **Questions**                | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/discussions) || ðŸ—¯ **Community**         | [Discord](https://discord.gg/5eXr5seRrv)  |### LicenseThis model is licensed under [Coqui Public Model License](https://coqui.ai/cpml).
